# Projects

## [1. Used Car Price Prediction & Business Dashboard](https://github.com/mathan-ponraj/Data-Driven-Used-Car-Price-Prediction-with-Business-Insights)
The project focuses on predicting used car selling prices using historical vehicle data to help dealers avoid overpricing and revenue loss.  
It includes data cleaning automation, feature engineering, regression modeling, and a Power BI dashboard for business insights.

Key highlights:
- End-to-end ML workflow (EDA → Cleaning → Modeling → Evaluation)
- Data pipeline to reduce manual data cleaning effort  
- Feature engineering to simplify model complexity  
- Linear Regression model for interpretable price prediction  
- Business-oriented dashboard for pricing insights  

Keywords: Regression, EDA, Feature Engineering, Power BI, Scikit-learn, Business Analytics

## [2. YouTube Trending Data ETL (Python, SQLAlchemy & SQLite)](https://github.com/mathan-ponraj/YouTube-Trending-Data-ETL-with-Python-SQLAlchemy-and-SQLite)
This project implements a complete ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) workflow to collect trending YouTube video data from the API, clean and transform it, and load it into a SQLite database for SQL-based analysis.

The system automates data extraction, preprocessing, and storage to make the data analysis-ready instead of doing manual analysis.

Key highlights:
- API data extraction using Python  
- Data transformation and cleaning using Pandas  
- Database loading using SQLAlchemy and SQLite  
- SQL-based exploratory and analytical queries  
- Automated ETL workflow for reusable data processing  

Keywords: ETL, API, SQLAlchemy, SQLite, Data Engineering, SQL, Pandas

## [3. Laptop Recommendation and Rating Prediction System (Streamlit)](https://github.com/mathan-ponraj/Laptop-Price-And-Recommendation-System)
This project is a machine learning-based recommendation system that predicts laptop ratings and suggests suitable laptops based on user preferences like budget, RAM, storage, and brand.  
It is deployed as an interactive web application using Streamlit.

Key highlights:
- Data cleaning and exploratory data analysis  
- Feature engineering on categorical and numerical features  
- XGBoost regression model for rating prediction  
- User input-based recommendation system  
- Deployed interactive web app using Streamlit  

Keywords: Recommendation System, Regression, Streamlit, XGBoost, EDA, Machine Learning
