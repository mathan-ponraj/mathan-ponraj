## Hi, I'm Mathan Ponraj 👋

I'm a **fresher in data analytics and data science**, with hands-on experience gained through internships, academic work, and real-world projects.

I work on learning-focused projects that involve **data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, basic machine learning models, and simple dashboards**. I enjoy understanding datasets, asking the right questions, and using data to find meaningful patterns.

My primary skills include **Python and SQL**, along with tools like **Power BI and Excel** for reporting and visualization. I’m comfortable working with core Python libraries such as Pandas and NumPy, and I’m gradually strengthening my understanding of statistics and machine learning fundamentals.

Currently, I’m continuing to improve my skills in:
- Data analysis and visualization  
- Writing clean and readable Python code  
- Applying basic machine learning techniques  
- Understanding how data supports business decisions  

I’m always open to learning, feedback, and collaboration on beginner-friendly data projects.
